## Agchoniôn

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):

Decan	:	Agchoniôn
Sephirah	:	Netzach
Influence	:	The decan of noise, music, and hearing, Agchoniôn overlaps somewhat with its neighboring decan, as the air of Isrö vibrates to produce the lilting (or blaring) tones of Agchoniôn. Agchoniôn alone does not convey meaning, however; languages are part of the domain of Naôth.
Places	:	Sonar stations, opera and concert houses, wind tunnels or narrow canyons, echo chambers.
Materials	:	Bat’s ears, dolphin blood, recording tape, seashells, theremin music, parrot feathers, glass shattered by sound, bright yellow-green.
```

## Akhouiy

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):

Decan	:	Akhouiy
Influence	:	Akhouiy energizes (if that’s the apt term) indolence, drift, ease, and luck, especially “dumb luck” or “fools’ luck.” Not stagnant like Alath, Akhouiy simply “goes with the flow.” Some Orientalist mages claim that Taoist magic is really a college drawn from Akhouiy.
Places	:	Casinos, resort hotels, some taverns, much of Faërie, fountains (with coins), wishing wells.
Materials	:	Four-leaf clovers, rabbits’ feet, upright horseshoes, beer, dice, stones with water-eroded holes through them, the small bone of a sheep’s head, honey, deep orange.
```

## Akton

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Akton
Influence	:	Where the decay of Kurtaêl is most often the physical result of natural processes, its counterpart within Akton is the decadence of the spirit, or the self-created mutilation of soul, culture, or body. Akton instills corruption, debauchery, both the cruel and queasy joys of sin and its debilitation and ravages.
Places	:	Alcoholic wards, whorehouses, crack dens, certain temples in North Africa, slave markets, the edge of the Abyss.
Materials	:	Vomit, maggots, vitriol, cocaine, wormwood, venereal pus, pale yellow.
```

## Alath

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Alath
Influence	:	Alath creates satiety, comfort, rest, the steady state, boredom, stagnation, and stasis. Alath may be another crucial decan in the “damping out” of magical static or destructive energies where less compatible decans intersect.
Places	:	Old-age homes, cold deserts, still tarns, ghost towns, a select London gentlemen’s club.
Materials	:	Tortoiseshell, square and cuboid shapes, arsenic, ether, morphia or heroin, deep wine-purple.
```

## Alleborith

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Alleborith
Influence	:	Some see Alleborith as the essential medium of magical transmission, others as the particulate energies of mana, still others as an abstraction for that portion of Barsafael and Anostêr which mages have mapped. In base, however, it is the decan present in magic at its most pure and isolate, the “active” reflection of “passive” Kumeatêl.
Places	:	Magical laboratories, pentacles, places of power, ley intersections, mana upwellings, Atlantis.
Materials	:	Mandrake root, orichalcum, azoth, pyramid shapes, black cat whiskers, water from Atlantis, green moonstones, pineal glands, bright azure.
```

## Anatreth

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Anatreth
Influence	:	While Iudal is transition itself, the act of crossing depends upon Anatreth, the decan of movement, evolution, progress, and speed (fast or slow). Anatreth primarily impels physical movement, but astral or spiritual movement carries much of Anatreth’s impulse within it.
Places	:	Tornadoes, airports, speedways or freeways, lightning strikes, bullet-trains and their tracks.
Materials	:	Arrows, bullets, fulgurites, cobra venom, hawk or osprey feathers, methamphetamine, henbane, violet.
```

## Anostêr

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Anostêr
Influence	:	Some mages theorize that Anostêr, by definition, cannot exist – at least not as the Cabal understands it. It comprises that which cannot be done, that which cannot be known, the impossible, the unnamable, the reverse face of knowledge and skill, the void that preceded creation.
Places	:	Some peculiar rings of stone in New England, an isolated atoll in the Pacific, a mirage city in the Arabian desert, a hot spring beneath Antarctica.
Materials	:	The noise of a cat’s passage, books never written, blood from a stone, imperceptible colors.
```

## Arôtosael

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Arôtosael
Influence	:	This decan drives the cyclic process of creation and destruction in all its facets, from assembling pieces of knowledge to destroying a city in an atomic blast. Arôtosael most strongly irrupts during the intermediate stages, when enough components have appeared to make the result apparent, or when the structure will fall with just one good shove.
Places	:	Decisive battlefields, particle accelerators, chemical or alchemical laboratories, blacksmith shops, beehives, new forests, the Sargasso Sea.
Materials	:	Ram’s horn (and anything else in a Fibonacci spiral), flint, clay, radioactives, E above high C, hammers, sage, murex dye or anything else reddish-purple
```

## Atrax

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Atrax
Influence	:	Where Roêlêd protects the body, Atrax nourishes it. This decan is the day-to-day inner strength of things renewed by sunlight (for plants), food (for animals), or worship (for deities). Atrax shades into health and healing – though more as a steady state than a dramatic process – and also, naturally, into decay (food, of course, for bacteria and worms).
Places	:	Supermarkets, bazaars, farmland, compost heaps, restaurants, gas stations, granaries, some fields in Sicily and Egypt.
Materials	:	Bread, salt, woman’s hair, storax, saliva, fertilizer, peridots, light yellowish-tan.
```

## Axiôphêth

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Axiôphêth
Influence	:	This decan may serve as another powerful “anchor” for reality. Axiôphêth empowers gravity, weight and mass, and forces holding things in place, often including oppression for its own sake.
Places	:	Underneath tons of rock, sun-baked desert flats, labor camps, prisons, sweatshops, particularly oppressive cubicle farms, slave galleys, certain mountains in the Pamirs.
Materials	:	Lead chains, iron weights, ballast from a ship that has traveled around the world, depleted uranium, indigo.
```

## Barsafael

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Barsafael
Influence	:	This decan is the hidden truth, the subconscious mind, primal unconfessed emotions and unknown strengths. Some mages theorize that Barsafael underlies all the other decans, while others believe that as the Cabal explores more of the Realms, Barsafael’s essence shrinks (or, possibly, continues to create more unknown territories).
Places	:	Deep beneath the ocean or in hidden caves, cities unknown to mankind, dinosaur burial grounds, fragmentary worlds long forgotten, very old mountaintops in the Appalachians, limestone sinkholes in upper Quebec.
Materials	:	Ambergris, petroleum, white noise, artesian water, taproots of plants, “U” shapes, crimson.

## Belbel

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Belbel
Influence	:	The decan of pain and torment, of sharpness and shadow, of shock and loss: few mages explore these many aspects of Belbel. Many of the ghostly undead (especially shades and shadows) derive their essence from the emanations of this decan.
Places	:	Torture chambers, death camps, deep in the rain- forests where sunlight never falls, widows’ walks, the shadow-burns in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the edges of the Abyss. 
Materials	:	Funeral crepe, surgical steel, rust, ammonia, neurotoxins, dried blood, nettles, purple so dark that it appears black.
```

## Bianakith

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Bianakith
Influence	:	If man is the measure of all things, then Bianakith is the template to which that measure is drawn. Although humanity, as the primary intermediary between microcosm and macrocosm, encompasses (at least potentially) all the decans, it is within the medium of meat and bone and desire and thought established by this decan that they must operate.
Places	:	Crowded cities, human-scale statuary, portrait galleries, gymnasia.
Materials	:	Lungwort, liverwort, elm, river clay, human blood or skin, starfish, GI Joe or Barbie doll or any other idealized poppet, ivory.
```

Decan	:	Buldumêch
Influence	:	This decan energizes wealth and treasure, from giving gold its glitter to building stock-market castles in the air. Within Buldumêch’s penumbra lie concepts as arcane as currency arbitrage and as basic as greed.
Places	:	Banks, stock market floors, gold mines, customs houses, money changers, jewelers, treasure troves.
Materials	:	Money, anything expensive and hoarded, jackdaw or magpie feathers, cowrie shells, sapphires, toad venom, gold.
```

or the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Charchnoumis
Influence	:	This decan imbues all animal life, bestial thoughts, predation, pack behavior, and such instincts. As a result, Charchnoumis is a very powerful component of human beings, and provides mana for the majority of lycanthropes and other animalistic shapeshifters.
Places	:	Zoos, slaughterhouses, nature preserves, forests, fresh animal tracks or kills, watering holes, Mount Ararat.
Materials	:	Fresh animals’ blood or skin, bloodstones, fresh game spoor, hunters’ weapons, civet musk, hunting-horn music, anything dark blood-red.

Decan	:	Eneuth
Influence	:	Fire, the untamed element; man’s first mystery. As the elemental decan of fire, Eneuth sparks not just the fires of stars and gas grills but the lively fires of inspiration and lust, of war and demagoguery.
Places	:	Bonfires, firestorms, tropical or subtropical deserts at midday, war-torn lands to the south, lava flows, magmatic caverns, the Plane of Fire.
Materials	:	Obsidian, asbestos, sulfur, fire opals, sodium, magnesium, rocket fuel, ash-wood wands, cones, olibanum, garlic, mustard, cayenne pepper, orange-yellow.
```

## Harpax

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Harpax
Influence	:	This decan sends sap through mighty cedars and spangles the ponds with algae. All things green and growing, both harmful and healing, have their taproots somewhere in the decan of Harpax.
Places	:	Sacred groves, rainforests, algal pools, weed-ridden croplands, hedge mazes.
Materials	:	Green jade, holly, cedar, woodwind music, amanita mushrooms, ivy, coral, forest green.

Decan	:	Hephesimereth
Influence	:	This decan is nothing, quite literally. It imbues creation with defeat, emptiness, and loss. Particularly pessimistic mages believe that eventually every decan will wind up in the sack of Hephesimereth.
Places	:	Open abandoned pits, former cemeteries with the bodies disinterred, frozen Antarctic desert, the intergalactic vacuum, places where the ground has been sown with salt.
Materials	:	Dead batteries, dust from an abandoned house, ashes, mistletoe, no color.

Decan	:	Ieropaêl
Influence	:	Second of the elemental decans, Ieropaêl helps solidly anchor reality as the embodiment and empowerment of earth, soil, rock, of the very concept of physicality itself.
Places	:	Mountain caves, volcanoes, upthrust crags, grav- el beds and quarries, city parks, fertile land in the north, the Plane of Earth.
Materials	:	Quartz, talc, slate, oak, lichen, worms, narcissus, orbs, dark brown.

Decan	:	Isrö
Influence	:	Air, at peace and in storms, coheres from the energies of Isrö. Not only zephyrs and hurricanes, but also the “lightning strike” of genius, the “airy chatter” of gossips, and the “windy oratory” of politicians derive from it.
Places	:	Windstorms, steppes, inside or atop clouds, on balloons or airships, cities atop plateaus in the east, the Plane of Air.
Materials	:	Eagle feathers, chalcedony, galbanum, white orchids, helium, bird-bone knives, aspen, pink-white.

Decan	:	Iudal
Influence	:	Boundaries, roads, portals, rivers, bridges, and other liminal and transitional thoughts and things form from the energies of Iudal. Iudal also emerges in concepts of time, distance, and measurement, and powers bridge-trolls.
Places	:	Bridges, crossroads, doorways (especially post- and-lintel ones), boundary markers, rivers, interdimensional gates, outdoors during an eclipse, grandfather clocks.
Materials	:	Keys, two-headed coins, juniper, alexandrites, tobacco, hollow bones, chalk, mirrors, rose-madder, cesium, cornmeal, amber.

Decan	:	Kumeatêl
Influence	:	Kumeatêl empowers hidden contention and unknown victory, the ace up a sleeve or the corps held in reserve, as well as secrets (especially decisive ones), murmurs, and even some aspects of codes, glyphs, and runes. Where Barsafael is the Unknown, Kumeatêl is the Hidden, the Occult, and thus may be seen to partially embody magic itself.
Places	:	Secret laboratories or military bases, hidden rooms or passages, labyrinths, lost cities, conspiratorial fast- nesses, pocket dimensions, certain university libraries.
Materials	:	Artifacts with secrets, the number 13, walnuts, handcuffs, Christmas wrapping ribbon, silk cord, knots with hidden ends, rose (both the flower and the color).

Decan	:	Kurtaêl
Influence	:	Where the decay of Kurtaêl is most often the physical result of natural processes, its counterpart within Akton is the decadence of the spirit, or the self-created mutilation of soul, culture, or body. Akton instills corruption, debauchery, both the cruel and queasy joys of sin and its debilitation and ravages.
Places	:	Graveyards, terminal wards of hospitals, ruined buildings where people have died, plague pits, tombs, marshes, necromantic altars in Haiti, Transylvania, and elsewhere.
Materials	:	Rowan, cypress, myrrh, contaminated syringes, rats, yew, hellebore, onyx, ebony, jet, pitch, any- thing black.
```

Decan	:	Marderô
Influence	:	This decan energizes rebellion against comfort, and anger at injustice – as well as violent reaction born from fear of chaos and disorder. Marderô also drives mutations, changes born of crisis and stimulus, and the concept of the opportune disaster.
Places	:	Revolutionary battlefields or massacres, police stations, some government buildings, meteor craters, disaster sites.
Materials	:	Hammers, sickles, human blood, pepper, tear gas, axes, five-pointed stars (but not pentagrams), gunpowder, rhino hide, white-flecked azure.

Decan	:	Methiax
Influence	:	Where Arôtosael assembles and disassembles matter, concepts, and energies, but Methiax creates them – or, rather, creates creation itself. Since (magically even more than mathematically) the final appearance of all matter is inherent within its smallest fragments, the impulse of creation is also the impulse of form. Methiax shapes both realities and dreams without regard for any difference that mundanity might insist exists. Some shapeshifters and phantasms draw mana from this decan.
Places	:	Artist’s studios, movie theaters and movie sets, counterfeiter’s dens, certain very old vineyards in Greece and Turkey, hallucinations and hallucinogenic spaces, induced dream states, Faërie, copy centers and scriptoria.
Materials	:	Pyrites, zircons, flashbulbs, eggs, pomegranate seeds, fractals, holograms, hallucinogens, fog, or any- thing gray.
```

## Naôth

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Naôth
Influence	:	What Iudal is to the material experience, Naôth is to the conceptual one – the creator and sustainer of communication, language, imagery, symbolism, and teaching. Not only the media of communication but the urge to communicate arise from Naôth, which connects everything on many levels.
Places	:	Radio stations, printers, shared telepathic experiences, shared or archetypal dream states, universities, a few select bars, certain bookshops in London and Paris.
Materials	:	Vervain, bay leaves, “V” shapes, stringed instruments or their strings, blue-gray.
```

## Nefthada

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Nefthada
Influence	:	This decan impels pleasure and delight, enabling thrills physical and mental. Often Nefthada is only perceptible at single, almost painfully perfect moments: the meadow under a rainbow, the first bite of steak, the second swallow of cognac – but its influence is in all those things forever.
Places	:	Almost nowhere, save for perfect moments in time or space; some English and Japanese gardens achieve correspondence with Nefthada on a continuing basis, as do a very few building interiors.
Materials	:	Champagne, star sapphires, silk or satin fab- rics, morning dew, pure oxygen, bright green.
```

## Ouare

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Ouare
Influence	:	This decan governs constructs, machines, alloys, and vehicles. Although Ouare’s college was one of the most recently codified (by the Heronians in the 2nd century A.D.), it is coeval with all the other decans, as far as the Cabal can determine. Some animate golems, cyborgs, and revenants take mana from this decan.
Places	:	Garages, metallurgical laboratories, inside moving vehicles, virtual-reality matrices, the Autobahn
Materials	:	Gears and clockwork, plastic, microchips, brass, aluminum, olive-green, any artificial dye such as aniline.
```

## Phoubêl

```
For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Phoubêl
Influence	:	This decan would seem to embody the Manichaean contradiction, that light cannot exist without darkness to define it. Phoubêl deals equally with both, and thus also with vision, blindness, and irreconcilable conflict.
Places	:	Tropical beaches, outdoors at sunrise or sunset, tanning salons, cathedrals, stone circles, fireworks shows
Materials	:	Heliotropes and other tropical flowers, flash- lights, cinnamon, “X” or cross shapes, laurel and hazelwood, black-and-white (or black-and-red) checkerboard patterns.

Decan	:	Phthenoth
Influence	:	Impelling cleansing, restoration, and healing both physical and metaphorical, Phthenoth brings about the renaissance of body and spirit throughout reality. Repair of machines, of course, is the province of Ouare, although areas of overlap may exist for some golems and homunculi.
Places	:	Hospitals, the island of Cos, spring meadows after a rain, arches, Avalon.
Materials	:	Balm, pure water, apples, watered wine, chicken soup, potash, Greek (“+”) crosses, lavender
```

Decan	:	Roêlêd
Influence	:	This decan imbues walls with their strength, thorns with their sharpness, shields with their glancing curves, antibiotics with their efficacy. Along with defense and guardianship, Roêlêd drives alertness, preparation, wisdom of experience, and that “sixth sense” that tells you you’re being watched. Many wraiths, and some trolls, derive their mana from this decan.
Places	:	Anywhere under surveillance or an electric-eye grid, castles and fortresses, missile silos and radar stations, firebreaks, guardhouses.
Materials	:	Owl or raven feathers, oxhide, “M” shapes, dragon’s blood, unicorn horn, sirens and alarms, dog barks, tiger lilies, Kevlar, chain links, bronze (both the metal and the color).

Decan	:	Ruax
Influence	:	This decan creates strength of will, connects perceptions to the mind, and governs sanity, drunkenness, the hotter emotions, sleep, and the material phenomena of dreams (although their content may fall within another decan).
Places	:	Television studios or showrooms, hypnosis clinics or performances, drug parlors and opium dens, asylums, personal dreamscapes, memory palaces, certain lamaseries in Central Asia.

Decan	:	Sahu
Influence	:	The decan of the giants, Sahu impregnates concepts and activities such as archery, hunting, and herding as well as their physical associations such as mountains, forests, grasslands, and other wild spaces. For some reason, this decan also manifests in high stone walls; possibly as an analogy to mountains.
Places	:	Mountainsides, the walls of Mycenae and Machu Picchu, the Kenyan high veldt, imposing statues or stone structures such as Mount Rushmore or the Sphinx and Pyramids of Giza.
Materials	:	Basalt, sequoia wood, subsonics, arrowheads, sinew, fresh animal blood, opals, anything red and black.

Influence	:	This decan covers not only physical water (and more generally liquids), but conceptual water as well: that which “flows easily” or “is hard to pin down.” Like the other elemental decans, it likely plays a key role both underpinning physical reality and in blending conceptual reality so that humans can perceive it without massive dissonance.
Places	:	Oceans, lakes, ships, reservoirs, wells and oases, ice rinks, sewers, islands to the west, the Plane of Water, the Pearl-Bright Ocean.
Materials	:	Fish, the blood of drowned men, aquamarines and beryls, pearls, teardrop shapes, chalices, lotuses, ferns, kelp, Irish whiskey, the color blue.

For the following decan, generate a list of possible spells for that decan, including the name of the spell, a description of what it does, and the appropriate Practice based on the Mage the Awakening practices (Compelling, Knowing, Unveiling, Ruling, Shielding, Veiling, Fraying, Perfecting, Weaving, Patterning, Unraveling, Making, Unmaking):		
		
Decan	:	Sphandôr
Influence	:	This decan manifests both as the sensorium and as the intellect, perhaps best understood as the passive counterpart to Ruax’s mental processes. In addition to things sensed and things thought (including arts and humanities), Sphandôr permits intuition and divination.
Places	:	Computer rooms, hexagonal spaces, paintings or images of eyes, theatrical stages (especially the Globe), libraries (especially Alexandria).
Materials	:	Agates and cat’s eyes, musk, hexagons, fennel, ringing bells, russet-red.

Decan	:	Tepsisem
Influence	:	Much as Phoubêl immanentizes both light and darkness, Tepsisem gives rise to beauty and to its loss, and thus to transience and impermanence; steady diminution rather than the catastrophes of Marderô.
Places	:	Museums, art auction houses, badly maintained (but once attractive) buildings, eroding statues.
Materials	:	Works of art, rouge, acid rain, faded photographs, broken mirrors, velvet, sandalwood, cut hibiscus or lilies, scarlet.
